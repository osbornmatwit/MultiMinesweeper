# MultiMinesweeper
# Introduction
Minesweeper is a puzzle video game. It is initially supposed to be a single player game, but we have programmed it to be a multiplayer game with the help of JavaFx and socket programming. The objective of the game is to provide an interesting challenge for the opponent while also challenging themselves.
